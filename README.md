# Transformer-sentiment-analysis
Sentiment analysis using the pre-trained BERT model from HuggingFace transformers pack and performing fine tuning for a sentiment classification task. To train and test the model, we will use tweets from datasets used in the competition: https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/linguipedia-codefest-natural-language-processing-1/#LeaderBoard.
